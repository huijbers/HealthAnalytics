\section*{Course Description}

Health analytics is a rapidly growing domain of data science. In this course, we will focus on key concepts in healthy analytics and epidemiology. We will discuss the application of these concepts in research and their impact public health and society. For example, we will explore how data collection is often limited by observational biases. Observational biases typically influence the outcome of an analysis and thus results. Understanding of epidemiological concepts is therefore crucial for the interpretation of results, especially in context of large amounts of health data. The course will put emphasis on theory, ideas, and epidemiological axioms. Theory will be combined with hands-on exercises in exploratory data analysis, data visualization and basic predictive models. During the course, practitioners working in the field of health analytics will be invited to discuss applications in different medical contexts.

% Second Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Required Materials} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Book: Bhopal RS. Concepts of Epidemiology. Oxford University Press; 2002  
\item Scientific articles (weekly announced on Blackboard)
\end{itemize}

% Third Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Prerequisites}
Basic understanding of biology is helpful, as is some familiarity with illness and disease, but a medical background in not necessary. The exercises and assignments will consist of simple math, statistics and programming in R. No prior knowledge is required, but without any programming experience, some additional work will be required, in order to keep up.

% Fourth Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Learning Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reproduce basic concepts in Epidemiology
\item Efficiently read and interpret scientific articles
\item Apply analysis methods and visualization in R
\item Master statistics for health analytics
\item Present on a research project
\item Discuss current topics in health analytics and epidemiology


\end{enumerate}

% Fifth Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Course Structure}

\subsection*{Class Structure}

The course will consist of two meetings each week. The first meeting is focused around the content of the book/articles and combines class discussions with lectures. The second meeting is focused around hands on data science and will provide context for the assignments, practical assistance, Q\&A and student presentations.

\subsection*{Assessments}

The course will be examined through a final exam, three assignments and one presentation. To participate in the final exam, students will answer weekly discussion questions and practical assignments in data analysis and visualization. These will be announced weekly. The discussion questions and data analysis assignment should be uploaded on BlackBoard and are Pass/Fail. The partake in the final exam, the student is allowed to miss two assignments at maximum.



\subsection*{Grading Policy}
The final course grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{\textbf{70\%}} of your grade will be determined by the final exam.
	\item \underline{\textbf{25\%}} of your grade will be determined by assignments \\
	assignment 1 (5\%), assignment 2 (5\%) and assignment 3 (15\%)
	\item \underline{\textbf{5\%}} of your grade will be determined by the presentation

\end{itemize}
